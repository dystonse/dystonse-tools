# dystonse-tools

**This repository is a part of the multi-repository project `dystonse`. See the [main repository](https://github.com/lenaschimmel/dystonse) for more information.**

Here we collect several small tools which do not need separate repositories.

## Agencies
These tools help us to get an overview of all existing transport agencies in Germany. See the [README](agencies/README.md) there.

## Legacy tool(s)
There is an old, Java based tool for collection data in the `legacy` folder. See the [README](legacy/README.md) there for more information. It also contains some old plans for a prediction tool.
